######## ABC ###########
#Update 12th August

ODE parameters for the Alcohol curve are in parameter_sample_Alcohol_1K.csv. These were obtained using the pyABC_Cleaning.py code.
So technically we can load these values directly into the PAM_Cleaning_Curves.R code instead of the random values we have currently.

Cleaning_ABC.R is an ABC rejection algorithm in R. There is also an SMC algorithm undereath it but I can't get it to work. I have a python code that works fine though. (pyABC_Cleaning.py)

To run Cleaning_ABC.R all you need to to is change the experimental data hard-coded into it. it will spit out a dataframe with 1000 best values for the parameters.
initial_contamtination=c(Contamination=59) #This is the initial value immediately after cleaning (time=0)
experimental_data= c(Contamination@time1,Contamination@time2,...,Contamination@time24)
s=standard deviation

To run the pyhon code, I recommend installing anaconda and using spyder. I've had no end of hassle with stand-along python installations.



######## PAMCODE ###########

This is based on the PPE code but includes the cleaning curve ODES. as yet it uses random values for the parameters, these need estimating first using either the Cleaning_ABC.R code or the pyABC_Cleaning.py SMC code. Should just run and produce boxplots of exposure at each time-point. Bit rough around the edges (assumes only 1 hand is used and homogeneous spread around the room)
