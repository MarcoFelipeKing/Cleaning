allCleanDataStephanie is the amalgamation of the results for both studies. It's cbased on her categories: no growth 0/cm2, scanty growth >2.5cfu/cm2, low growth >12/cm2, medium growth >26/cm2 and high growth >40/cm2. These numbers might not be right, but they're an approximation from memory (on 12th of August 2020). Data in the file is faithfully transcribed though.
